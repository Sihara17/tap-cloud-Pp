## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant cyan (#00FFFF) to reflect the energy theme, and the cyan present in the source image.
- Background color: A dark desaturated blue (#0A0B0D) to create a sense of depth, as well as high contrast with the cyan, ensuring readability of elements, in accordance with the dark scheme and cosmic setting suggested in the image.
- Accent color: A cool, desaturated, slightly greenish-blue (#33C6B8) to give highlights that harmonize with the primary and background.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font suitable for the title and descriptions within the interface, since it complements a contemporary tech aesthetic. For blocks of body text, use 'Inter'.
- Use clean, outlined icons related to energy and cloud concepts to maintain a minimalist design.
- Design a responsive layout optimized for mobile screens, ensuring usability on LINE's LIFF browser.
- Implement subtle animations, like a gentle glow effect around the cloud, to convey an impression of energy.
